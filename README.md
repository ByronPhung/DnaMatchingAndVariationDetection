# Hardware-Accelerated DNA Matching and Variation Detection Using a FPGA
This project is part of a senior project being pursued at Cal Poly Pomona to use a FPGA to hardware-accelerate DNA sequence matching and variation detection. Software will be used to serve as a working performance baseline while the final implementation will be using Verilog to simulate hardware performance
